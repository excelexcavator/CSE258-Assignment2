This is the course project for UCSD CSE258: Web Mining and Recommender Systems. We aim to predict the overall ratings on a beer reviews dataset.

The exploratory data analysis is in [EDA.ipynb](./EDA.ipynb)

We have used a [Latent Factor Model](./Latent Factor.ipynb), [Random Forests and Neural Networks](./Random Forest & NN.ipynb) to solve this problem. 

Final report is [here](./Report.pdf)
